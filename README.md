[Intro]
(Invisible)
(Invisible)
(Invisible)
(Invisible)

[Verse 1]
(Shy one) Walking by the wall
(Shy one) The shadows will not fall
(Shy one) Is silently ignored
(Quiet one) Discouraged by the noise
(Quiet one) Living without choice
(Quiet one) Is a life without a voice

[Chorus 1]
When you can't even say my name
Has the memory gone? Are you feeling numb?
Go and call my name
I can't play this game, so I ask again
Will you say my name?
Has the memory gone? Are you feeling numb?
Or have I become invisible?

[Verse 2]
(Sky light) Thе dreamers wish away
(Hindsight) It's falling on my face
(Highlights) Thе shape of my disgrace

[Chorus 2]
When you don't hear a word I say
As the talking goes, it's a one-way flow
No fault, no blame
Has the memory gone? Are you feeling numb?
And have I become invisible?

[Bridge]
(Invisible)
(Invisible)
(Invisible)
(Invisible)
(Invisible)
(Invisible)
(Invisible)
(Invisible)
(Invisible)

[Chorus 3]
No one hears a word they say
Has the memory gone? Are you feeling numb?
Not a word they say
But a voiceless crowd isn't backing down
When the air turns red
With a loaded hesitation
Can you say my name?
Has the memory gone? Are you feeling numb?
Have we all become invisible?
